## Overview

Built using the **Laravel** and **Vue.js** stack, this project was developed as part of my **Associate's Degree (DUT)** graduation project at **Ecole Supérieure de Technologie Kénitra** (March 2024 - April 2024).

This platform provides a seamless experience for users looking to buy, rent, or sell vehicles, combined with robust administrative tools for managing the system.
